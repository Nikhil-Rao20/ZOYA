Welcome to the ZOYA GitHub repository! ZOYA is an interactive humanoid robot, designed to engage in conversations with students, offer career guidance, and bring a touch of fun to campus life through casual chit-chats. The project was built using **Python**, **Generative AI**, **Langchain**, **Speech Synthesis**, and **OpenAI**, and was deployed on a **Raspberry Pi** to make it portable and accessible. ZOYA was showcased at **Teckzite 2024** at **RGUKT Nuzvid**, where it achieved a **Top 2** position.

## Features üåü
- **Conversational AI**: ZOYA can converse with university students on a variety of topics.
- **Career Guidance**: It provides helpful insights and advice for students on their career paths.
- **Fun Interactions**: From fun conversations to quick chats, ZOYA is designed to make student life more engaging.
- **Portable Design**: Powered by Raspberry Pi, ZOYA is compact and easy to move around.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
- **Python**: Core programming language for developing ZOYA's functionalities.
- **Generative AI & Langchain**: Used to enable dynamic and natural language conversations.
- **Speech Synthesis**: For voice output, allowing ZOYA to respond audibly.
- **OpenAI API**: For powering intelligent responses in conversations.
- **Raspberry Pi**: Deployed on a Raspberry Pi board to ensure ZOYA is portable and accessible.
